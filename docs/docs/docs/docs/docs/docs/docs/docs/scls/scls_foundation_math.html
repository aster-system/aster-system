<h2>
    Mathematical functions
</h2>
<section>
    SCLS Foundamental Math contains some (C++) functions made to execute (mathematicals) functions.&lt;/br&gt;
    It has functions used in the image handling, like the "paeth_function".
    <h3>
        Functions

    <article>
        <h4>
            float paeth_function(float left, float above, float upper_left)
        </h4>
        <div>
            Apply the paeth function to the "left", "above" and "upper_left" value.
            See the <a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2/PNG-Filters.html" target="_blank">W3 Consortium</a> PNG website to have more informations about it.

<h2>
    Get mathematicals datas
</h2>
<section>
    If you want to get datas about something mathematicly, without any functions, SCLS Foundamental Math allows it.
    This functions are not hard to code at all, but it's a gain of time to have them already coded in SCLS.
    You can normalize a value between two other values with "normalize_value".
    You can get the sign of a double with the "sign" function.
    <h3>
        Functions
    </h3>
    <article>
        <h4>
            double normalize_value(double number, double min, double max)
        </h4>
        <div>
            Return the double "number" normalized between "min" and "max" both included.
            This function is very similar to the "mod" function.
            if max is tinier than min, the 2 values are swapped. If max - min = 0, 0 is returned.
        </div>
        <h4>
            int sign(double number)
        </h4>
        <div>
            Return the sign of "number", -1 or 1.
