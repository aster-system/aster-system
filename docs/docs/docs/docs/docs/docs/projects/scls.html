        <div>
            SCLS, for "Simple C++ Libraries Set", is a sets of C++ library, which means to make C++ development <i>almost</i> as easy as in Python.<br />
            The main goal of the library is to be simply used, implemented, downloaded and reviewed.<br /><br />
            It targets mainly beginners or even seniors who don't want to develop some very simples and general things.
            For the simplest parts, the part is only header-only. For the most advanced libraries, you will needs some others libraries.
