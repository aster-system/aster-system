        <h3>What is SCLS Documentalist "Agatha" ?</h3>
        <div>
            SCLS Documentalist "Agatha" is a special part of the SCLS library. Indeed, it is not made more as a software than a real library.
            However, it is made to simplify the documentation, and it is Open Source. It has so its place here.

        <h3>The importance of SCLS Format "Mary"</h3>
        <div>
            SCLS Documentalist "Agatha" is made to take a dirty text, which can be code, explanation... and change it to a well documented text.
            To do that, it use a system of pattern of text. The user only have to enter the datas about something, and the library write correctly the text.<br /><br />
            When we got this idea, we knewn that we would have to adapt the library to be compatible with the C++ code.
            However, convert a complex and dirty C++ code to something like that is complicated.
            So, we thought about a specific code format, easily readable by the library and by a human developer.<br />
            This format is called <a href="format.html">SCLS Format "Mary"</a>.
