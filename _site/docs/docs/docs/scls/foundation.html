            SCLS Foundation "Leonhard" is the core library of the Aster System SCLS project.
            It unites a lot of core functionnality to use each others SCLS libraries.
            It is name "Leonhard", after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, also known as one of the "Father of the modern mathematics".

            If you're are new with C++, you can learn from this library.
            As the creator of the library, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND you to watch the code and learn from it. It is made to be simple to read and user-friendly.
            If you know well C++, you can watch the code too, but it's certainly not the better code you have watched in your life.

        It is made to be EXTREMELY easy to use. When you download the .zip, you can extract datas from it.
        You will find a file "scls_foundation.h" and a directory "scls_foundation_directory".
        You just have to put this two files in the same directory and include "scls_foundation.h" with :<br /><br />
        #include &lt;scls_foundation.h&gt; // If you put it in the same path as the compiler include<br />
        #include "scls_foundation.h" // If you do not put it in the same path as the compiler include<br /><br />
        After that, you will be able to use the library.<br /><br />
