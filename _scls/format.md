        <h3>What is SCLS Format "Mary" ?</h3>
        <div>
            SCLS Format "Mary" is a very special part of the SCLS library. Indeed, it is not code, but a way to format C++ code.
            It is made for simplicity, documentation, practicity, versionning and beauty.<br><br>
            It is named after the american author Mary Higgins Clark, a very famous writer of suspense novel.

        <h3>Base structuure</h3>
        <div>
            To be easily understandable, the file is cutted in each ways, with each ways has its special feature.<br><br>
            The first big part is the presentation of the file. It contains comments which present the file, with the file name, the project name, or others caracteristics.<br>
            This part is cutted in two tinier parts, the presentation in comments and the preprocessor directives of the start of the file (#include, #ifned...).<br>
            The way that each of these parts is represented is not very important, you can do how you want.<br><br>
